    	<h1>Reviewing Process</h1>

    	<p>Standards in life sciences provide an efficient management and automation of the processing of information flow in the different domains; in order to facilitate the creation and development of standards in life sciences, we propose this document as a guide. The entire reference document can be found on
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDHBfw6frl9xAjIduLYRwcqUY3jehfzJ-xSKCc1nSsc/edit?usp=sharing">Standard Specification Process</a>; for any enquiries you can send an email to <a href="mailto:community@bioschemas.org">community@bioschemas.org</a> or <a href="mailto:commons@bioschemas.org">commons@bioschemas.org</a>.</p>

    	<h2>Documents</h2>

    	<p>Documents fall into one of the following categories:</p>

    	<ul>
    		<li><strong>Community Documents</strong>, which inform and influence the community regarding an approach or process that is considered to be widely accepted by consensus and practice in the life sciences community.</li>
    		<li><strong>Informational Documents</strong>, which inform the community of an interesting and useful life sciences-related technology, architecture, framework or concept.</li>
    		<li><strong>Recommendation Documents</strong>, which describe a particular technical specification or a particular set of guidelines for the application of a technical specification. Recommendations are intended to guide interoperability and promote standard approaches.</li>
    	</ul>

    	<h2>Document Process</h2>

    	<p>The process by which a document is designated as part of this Document Series consists of two levels of reviews. Editors may not participate in the review of their own documents.</p>

    	<h3>Preparatory phase</h3>

    	<p>A Draft Specification document is prepared by a dedicated group of experts (members of the Specification group). Besides the specification itself, the draft will also define the rationale for the standard, its purpose, and the target audience (the communities that will implement and use the standard). The status of the document is "<strong>Draft</strong>".</p>
    	<p>Lead Editor submits the draft for internal review to the communities and/or organizations involved in drafting the specification. The Lead Editor also ensures that the Draft Specification document is:</p>

    	<ol>
    		<li>In line with the appropriate templates and is clearly written.</li>
    		<li>Sufficiently detailed and clearly described to enable its evaluation and adoption by a broader community.</li>
    		<li>Doesn't create additional problems that should be addressed before the specification enters a public review phase (e.g. an overlap with an existing specification).</li>
    	</ol>

    	<h3>Internal review</h3>

    	<p>Draft Specification and associated material is posted in a dedicated GitHub project (receiving DOIs as relevant) and as a Google Doc. All internal stakeholders are invited to submit their comments on the proposed specification. The internal stakeholders have 30 days to submit their comments.</p>
    	<p>Lead Editor reviews the comments received and discusses them with the specification group:</p>

    	<ol>
    		<li>If a major revision of the draft is needed, it enters the preparatory phase whereby the specification group re-drafts the document. The new version is then submitted again for 30-day internal review.</li>
    		<li>If only minor changes are needed, the Lead Editor updates the draft accordingly and submits the new document to a public review. The status of the document changes from "Draft" to "<strong>Candidate</strong>".</li>
    	</ol>

    	<h3>Public review</h3>

    	<p>The Candidate Document goes through 30-60 days Public Review phase with larger community. The Candidate Specification Document and associated material is posted in a dedicated GitHub project (receiving the DOIs as relevant) and as a Google Doc.</p>
    	<p>The review process is publicly announced by the communities and/or organizations involved in drafting the specification (on their respective websites and social media, and through other channels as appropriate) and disseminated to other relevant communities and organizations (as defined in the specification). Review periods should also be announced on the relevant mailing lists (e.g. <a href="mailto:all-at-nodes@elixir-europe.org">all-to-nodes@elixir-europe.org</a>, <a href="mailto:public-schema@w3c.org">public-schema@w3c.org</a>) and communities (e.g. schema.org community group).</p>
    	<p>The Lead Editor will identify 3-5 people with the expertise required to evaluate the Candidate specification and directly invite them to send reviews to the Editor. For a broad specification, reviewers could be asked to focus on a specific area. The Candidate specifications may also be discussed in a dedicated workshop, with participants representing a broader community. A journal submission occurring in parallel to the public review is possible.</p>
    	<p>The feedback collected through the public review is evaluated by the Lead Editor, in consultation with the other editors, members of the specification group:</p>

    	<ol>
    		<li>No or only formal modifications are needed: the status of the document changes to "<strong>Final</strong>" and the review process closes. If necessary and relevant, the certification authority (e.g. schema.org) is notified.</li>
    		<li>Minor modifications are needed: the Lead Editor (in consultation with the other specification editors) prepares a new version of the document. The document then enters a 30 days "grace" period during which both internal and external stakeholders can submit their additional comments. The review process closes after the grace period, and is classified as "<strong>Final</strong>". If there are some additional comments during the grace period, the Lead Editor addresses the comments and releases a new version of the specification. The Lead Editor may restart the grace period when relevant and appropriate (depending on the comments received) and again invite all stakeholders to submit their comments.</li>
    		<li>Major changes are needed: the submitter is invited to restart the internal process of review and the status of the document goes back to "<strong>Draft</strong>". The external reviewers are invited to nominate their representatives to the group of editors and work on the new draft.</li>
    	</ol>
