description: "To deliver on the identified use cases for samples, we have identified a minimal set of properties to encapsulate identification, linking, and metadata descriptions.  Some of these properties are existing standard schema.org properties, others require Bioschemas extensions.  Table 1 outlines the minimal set of properties for the ‘Sample’ concept and Table 2 shows our recommendations for use of the ‘PropertyValue’ concept to markup additional characteristics of a sample described within a sample page. We also propose a new concept, ‘Biomedical Code’, which is a generalisation of the existing ‘Medical Code’ concept defined in the health-lifesci.schema.org extension.
Because we expect providers to be able to share partial information (to allow the complete picture to be assembled) all properties are optional in scope, there are no mandatory fields."
