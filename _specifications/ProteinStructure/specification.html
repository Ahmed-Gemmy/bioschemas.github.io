    set to http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_011119. If you want to add other
    terms, please contact Bioschemas.

  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    of <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a>, such as ISBNs,
    GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing
    many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See <a href="http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg">background
    notes</a> for more details.
