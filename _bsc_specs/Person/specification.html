description: The Life Science Person specification provides a way to describe bioscience
  events on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata and vocabularies, built
  on top of existing technologies and standards, that can be used to represent the
  profile information of people in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification
  is to make it easier to discover, life science profile information.
