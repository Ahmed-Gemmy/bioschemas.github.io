description: 'Provides a way to describe bioscience organizations on the World Wide
  Web. It defines metadata terms that can be used in the code of web pages and applications,
  and builds on top of existing technologies and standards. The goal of the specification
  is to make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate life science organization
  profiles across the Internet.
