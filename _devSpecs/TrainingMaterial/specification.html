description: The Life Science Training Materials specification provides a way to describe
  bioscience training material on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of metadata
  and vocabularies, built on top of existing technologies and standards, that can
  be used to represent events in Web pages and applications. The goal of the specification
  is to make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate life science training material
  information across the Internet.
