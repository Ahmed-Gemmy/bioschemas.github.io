  name: additionalType
  parent: Thing
  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    of <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Thing">Thing</a>, such as ISBNs,
    GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing
    many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See <a href="http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg">background
    notes</a> for more details.

    E.g. the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.

    ontologies: []
    terms: []
  expected_type:

  sdo_desc: URL of the item.
- bsc_dec: Additional to the use of name and description to describe this property
    in a human-readable way, additionalType should be used to specify the nature of
    the property/relation. For instance, if the property refers to a gene/protein
    disease association, you could use http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000983
    as additionalType for the additionalProperty. If appropriate terms/properties
    exist in controlled vocabularies, those should be used directly.

  marginality: Optional
  name: additionalProperty
  parent: Protein
  sdo_desc: 'A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the
    entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is
    no matching property in schema.org.  Note: Publishers should be aware that applications
    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.'

  marginality: Recommended
  name: bioschemas:transcribedFrom

  sdo_desc: Gene(s) from which this protein was transcribed from. In addtion to the

    associated to it

  sdo_desc: 'Indicates a BioChemEntity that is (in some sense) a part of this BioChemEntity.
    Inverse property: isContainedIn.'
- bsc_dec: In Bioschemas location can be refer to a position in a chromosome or sequence
    or to a physical place where, for instance, a sample is stored. Using additionalType
    is advised to make the distinction. For instance, FALDO can be used for sequence
    coordinates.

  marginality: Optional
  name: location
  parent: Protein
  sdo_desc: The location of for example where the event is happening, an organization
    is located, or where an action takes place.
- bsc_dec: This property could be used, for instance, to register a sequence protein
    as it is a representation of the protein. If you want to better define the nature
    of the representation, use a PropertyValue as described in additionalProperty.
  cardinality: MANY

  name: hasRepresentation

  sdo_desc: A representation for this entity other than, for instance, an image (used
    image property for that) or the main web page/record (use mainEntityOfPage for
    that, and see background notes, http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground,
    for sameAs and url).
