description: 'An experimental protocol is a sequence of tasks and operations executed
  to perform experimental research in biological and biomedical areas.

  Experimental protocols are fundamental information structures that support the description
  of the processes by means of which results are generated in experimental research
  [1]. Experimental protocols describe how the data were produced, the steps undertaken
  and conditions under which these steps were carried out.

  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.
