ELIXIR, GOBLET, Pistoia Alliance and other organisations and communities in life science have stated a joint initiative - the BioSchemas - to create a system for describing and sharing information and online content about activities relevant to life science disciplines (life science events, training materials, people, standards and life science organisations). This Community Workshop will formally kick-off the BioSchemas group, and present its goals and activities.

Following a series of preparatory meetings, it has been decided to build the system, using [schema.org](http://schema.org), an already established initiative to promote and maintain schemas for structured online data. The BioSchemas group was established during a specification hackathon, organised at the University of Birmingham on 20-21 October 2015. The event captured and formalised the results of the preparatory discussions and prepared a reference specifications on how to describe life science events, training materials, people, standards and life science organisations.
