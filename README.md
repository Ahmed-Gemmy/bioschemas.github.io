Several organisations and communities in life science have stated a joint initiative - BioSchemas - to facilitate the description and information sharing of organisational activitites (life science events, training materials, people, standards and life science organisations).

Following a series of preparatory meetings, it has been decided to build the system, using [schema.org](http://schema.org), an already established initiative to promote and maintain schemas for structured online data. The BioSchemas group was established during a specification hackathon, organised at the University of Birmingham on 20-21 October 2015. The event captured and formalised the results of the preparatory discussions and prepared a reference specifications on how to describe life science events, training materials, people, standards and life science organisations.
