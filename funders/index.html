            <h3>ELIXIR Bioschemas: Community Adoption and Training</h3>
            <p>Bioschemas is a <a href="/community/">community</a> initiative which aims to improve data discoverability in the life sciences and provide better exposure of our data repositories,
              including the ELIXIR Core and Node Data Resources, to generic search engines, such as Google, and domain specific repositories such as Identifiers.org, FAIRsharing.org, and DataMed.</p>

            <h3>ELIXIR Bioschemas Implementation Study</h3>
            <p>The aim of this <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/bioschemas">Implementation Study</a> is to deliver Bioschemas specifications and demonstrators for the following content types: Data repository, Dataset, Sample and Protein annotations. Additionally it will support the development of other content types like Phenotype and Beacons planned in other ELIXIR activities. The project will also provide support and engagement of the Bioschemas community, including meetings, hackathons, knowledge dissemination, and training in adoption of Bioschemas. The project is led by the <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability/bioschemas">ELIXIR Bioschemas working group</a>.</p>
