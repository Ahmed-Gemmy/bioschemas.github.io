			<h1>What is Bioschemas?</h1>
            <meta itemprop="logo" content="http://bioschemas.org/images/square_logo2.png"/>
            <meta itemprop="url" content="http://bioschemas.org"/>

			<p><span itemprop="name">Bioschemas</span> is an open community of organisations across the life science domains to facilitate dissemination and information exchange within all disciplines of life science. It is open to any organisation or individual, and currently has members from <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR</a>, <a href="http://www.pistoiaalliance.org/">Pistoia Alliance</a>, <a href="http://mygoblet.org/">GOBLET</a>, <a href="https://biosharing.org/">BioSharing</a> and <a href="http://bbmri-eric.eu/">BBMRI</a>.</p>

            <h2>Aims and approach</h2>

			<p>Bioschemas is working towards extending the existing metadata standards provided by <span itemprop="parentOrganization" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><meta itemprop="name" content="Schema.org" /><a href="http://schema.org" itemprop="url">schema.org</a></span> in events, training materials, people, and organizations in the life sciences, by developing three main components:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data model</strong> - extension of existing standards in schema.org. This extension will be submitted to schema.org and will - if accepted - become part of the schema standards;</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum information guidelines</strong> - guidelines how to use the proposed data model, defining each specification and explaining what kind of information should be provided;</li>
                <li><strong>Controlled vocabularies</strong> - controlled vocabularies that will bi used to describe some types of information (e.g. scientific topic for events, organisations, etc).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bioschemas is focused on being inductive and empirical, discovering what information people are already producing in life science and matching these to existing types and properties in schema.org; when this is not possible, Bioschemas tries to keep the required new properties or types as abstract as possible (i.e. not specific to life science), and propose a new property or type to the schema.org community.</p>
            <p>An important point in Bioschemas project is community effort: any new type or property proposal will be discussed, and anyone who is interested in applying schema.org standards to life science is welcome to join us on <a itemprop="sameAs" href="https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas">GitHub</a>, comment on the specifications and join our mailing lists. Specific use cases can be found on the <a href="/examples/index.html">Examples</a> page.</p>
