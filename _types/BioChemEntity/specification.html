group: BioChem Entity
description: 'A BioChemEntity is any object that exists in the physical world and
  cannot be better represented with any other existing type in schema.org. In order
  to specify the nature of this physical entity, additionalProperty must be used to
  specify the nature/type of this physical entity. For instance, http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_010043
  can be used to refer to a protein.


  Bioschemas usage


  A BioChemEntity is a flexible and extensible wrapper for Life Sciences entities.
  Representations of physical entities in Life Sciences are usually recorded in datasets;
  the link to a dataset should be done via properties. A particular Life Sciences
  entity, refer to as a profile in Bioschemas, will customize BioChemEntity by modifying
  the marginality, cardinality and ontologies used. For instance, a protein profile
  would recommend pointing to an organism a part of the minimum information, but not
  necessarily to a sample or disease.'

- bsc_dec: Bioschemas usage.   As BioChemEntity is a generic wrapper for entitties
    in Life Sciences, customized types (a.k.a. profiles in Bioschemas) should specify
    what ontologies and terms should be used. SIO (http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/SIO)
    covers a wide range of concepts in Life Sciences and accept suggestions about
    additions (see https://github.com/micheldumontier/semanticscience/issues), other
    ontologies are possible as well. Customized types should be as specific as possible.
    For instance, http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_010043 would work for a
    protein while http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000985 for a gene coding
    a protein (which is more specific than gene as described by http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_010035).
    If no better optoin, a generic term could be used as well (like http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000004
    or so).

  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.'
- bsc_dec: Bioschemas usage.  Additional to the use of name and description to describe
    this property in a human-readable way, additionalType should be used to specify
    the nature of the property/relation. For instance, if the property refers to a
    gene/protein disease association, you could use http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000983
    as additionalType for the additionalProperty.

    FALDO can be used for sequence coordinates.
