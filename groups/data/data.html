    	<h1>Data Group</h1>

		<p>This BioSchemas Data group focuses on describing data and working with <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>.</p>

		<h2>Purpose</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>To develop a common schema to facilitate description and dissemination of dataset as an extension of <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.</li>
			<li>To create a specification including a metadata schema, minimum information guidelines, recommended vocabularies as well as documentation and examples about how to use the data schema.</li>
			<li>To engage the community interested to describe file science data to participate and shape the specification.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Specifications</h2>

		<p>The specification will be developed leveraging on the work by related activities, to be progressively listed here:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The <a href="http://biocaddie.org">BD2K NIH bioCADDIE</a> project is working towards a DataMed prototype, to support data search as <a href="http://pubmed.org">PubMed</a> facilitates literature search. The <a href="https://biocaddie.org/workgroup-3-group-links">bioCADDIE Data Descriptor Working Group</a> has worked on defining the dataset description model <a href="http://github.com/biocaddie/WG3-MetadataSpecifications">DatA Tag Suite (DATS)</a> model specification, which is a model for describing datasets and enabling their discovery.</li>
			<li>To be added</li>
