        <h1>Data Repositories Group</h1>

        <p>The Bioschemas Data Repositories Group provides a way to describe bioscience data repositories on the World Wide Web.</p>

        <p>There are many data repositories available for storing and sharing life science data. To enable users to find these data repositories, various communities have built registries for their own particular purposes; populating and maintaining the content of these registries manually is a time consuming and sometimes error prone effort. In addition, depending upon the precise procedures by which information is updated, these repositories can become out of sync with the data provider, and with other such repositories.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>To develop a common schema to facilitate the description, discoverability, exchange and aggregation of data repositories information in the life science, using <a href="http://schema.org/" title="schema.org">schema.org</a>.</li>
            <li>To create a specification that includes a metadata schema, minimum information guidelines and recommended vocabularies. It should also include documentation and examples about how to use the data repositories schema.</li>
            <li>To engage the people that are interested in describing life science data repositories to participate and shape the specification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Products</h2>
        <h3>Specification</h3>
