    	<h1>Organization Group</h1>

    	<p>The Bioschemas Organization Group develops and mantains a community specification for describing life science organizations.</p>

        <p>Corporations, small businesses, individual consultants, academic institutes, multinationals, alliances, consortia, and informal working groups all have a part to play in the life sciences world. Each organization usually publishes information about itself on the web, and in the case of alliances and consortia that will include information about which other organizations comprise their membership, but none of this is carried out in an easily discoverable or integrated manner. This makes it hard to identify who is doing what and working with whom. Though there are technological solutions for sharing organization profiles in the life sciences, at the moment there is not a consistent manner to discover, exchange or compare this information.</p>

    	<h2>Purpose</h2>

    	<ul>
    		<li>To develop a common schema to facilitate description and dissemination of life science organizations as an extension of <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.</li>
    		<li>To create a specification including a metadate schema, minimum information guidelines, recommended vocabularies as well as documentation and examples about how to use the schema.</li>
    		<li>To engage the community interested to describe file science organizations to participate and shape the specification.</li>
    	</ul>

    	<h2>Specifications</h2>

    	<p>The current specifications can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nR3TS6xwtOH9IwXHnTbNW2kGi_APfLT0uid-6Ky7XDo/edit">Organization Specification</a> document, or you can check the entire list of <a href="full_organization.html">Bioschemas Organization properties</a>. Usage examples can be found on the <a href="/examples/index.html#organization">Examples</a> page.</p>
