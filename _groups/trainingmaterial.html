    	<h1>Training Material Group</h1>

    	<p>The Bioschemas Training Material Group develops and maintains a community specification for describing training materials in biosciences available on the internet.</p>

        <p>Training materials tend to be dispersed in an unstructured way around the Internet. They are mainly available off manually crafted web pages with a general lack of programmatic interfaces. Even though some training material providers make efforts to curate and structure their content, materials are still not described in a consistent manner that would make them easy to discover, exchange or compare programmatically.</p>

    	<h2>Purpose</h2>

    	<ul>
    		<li>To develop a common schema to facilitate the description and dissemination of life science training material, using <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.</li>
    		<li>To define a set of metadata and vocabularies, built on top of existing technologies and standards, that can be used to represent training materials in web pages and applications.</li>
    		<li>To make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate life science training material information across the internet.</li>
    	</ul>
