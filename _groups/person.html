    	<h1>Person Group</h1>

    	<p>The Bioschemas Person Group develops and maintains a community specification for describing life science people profiles.</p>

        <p>There is a wealth of descriptive information about people distributed across the web. Within the life science community, profiles of people can be found on institutional pages, project pages, community sites, repositories, and wikis amongst other online resources. These profiles often contain assortments of facts about people and their relationships to organizations and projects, such as biographic text, curriculum vitaes, positions held, roles, expertise, contact information, education, or photographs. Due to the heterogeneous nature of web pages and the differences in the terms used to describe profile information, search engines face difficulties interpreting profile pages to usefully expose facts in search results. For profiles of people in life sciences, there is also a lack of agreement on a common controlled vocabulary to define people's skill and expertise.</p>

    	<h2>Purpose</h2>

    	<ul>
    		<li>To develop a common schema to facilitate description and dissemination of life science people profiles as an extension of <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.</li>
    		<li>To create a specification including a metadate schema, minimum information guidelines, recommended vocabularies as well as documentation and examples about how to use the schema.</li>
    		<li>To engage the community interested to describe file science people profiles to participate and shape the specification.</li>
    	</ul>
