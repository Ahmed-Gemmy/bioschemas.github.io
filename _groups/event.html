    	<h1>Event Group</h1>

    	<p>The Bioschemas Event Group develops and maintains a community specification for describing life science events.</p>

        <p>Conferences, workshops, meetings and events in general play a very important role in knowledge sharing and acquisition of new skills. Though there are several technological solutions for event sharing, events in life sciences are still not described in a consistent manner that would make them easy to discover, exchange or compare. Because there is no single standard to follow, the dissemination, discovery and aggregation of events is not effective. As a result, the advertisement of an event in third party websites normally requires manual curation to shape the content to each provider's requirements.</p>

    	<h2>Purpose</h2>

    	<ul>
    		<li>To develop a common schema to facilitate the description and dissemination of life science events, using <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.</li>
    		<li>To create a specification that includes a metadata schema, minimum information guidelines and recommended vocabularies. It should also include documentation and examples about how to use the event schema.</li>
    		<li>To engage the people that are interested in describing life science events to participate and shape the specification.</li>
    	</ul>
