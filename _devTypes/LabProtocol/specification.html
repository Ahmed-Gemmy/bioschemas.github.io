description: 'An experimental protocol is a sequence of tasks and operations executed
  to perform experimental research in biological and biomedical areas.

  Experimental protocols are fundamental information structures that support the description
  of the processes by means of which results are generated in experimental research
  [1]. Experimental protocols describe how the data were produced, the steps undertaken
  and conditions under which these steps were carried out.

  name: additionalType
  parent: Thing
  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.
- bsc_dec: Bioschemas usage. Use in LabProtocol to include the step by step process
    followed in this protocol.

    structural elements are used to described advantages (situations the Protocol
    has been successfully employed), limitations (situations the Protocol would be
    unreliable or otherwise unsuccessful), applications (Applications of the protocol
    list the full diversity of the applications of the method and support if is possible
    to extend the range of applications of the protocol. e.g. northern blot assays,
    sequencing, etc.), and outcomes (outcome or expected result by a protocol execution).
