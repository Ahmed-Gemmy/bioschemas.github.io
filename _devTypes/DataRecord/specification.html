description: "A Record acts itself as a dataset although it refers to what could be
  seen as the minimum compact, complete and auto-descriptive unit in a dataset, i.e.,
  a record.\n\nBioschemas usage\n\nIn Life Sciences, records will represent a BioChemEntity.
  A link to the represented physical entity should be done via \u201Crepresents\u201D

  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.
