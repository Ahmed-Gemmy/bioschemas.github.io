description: 'A BioChemEntity is any object that exists in the physical world and
  cannot be better represented with any other existing type in schema.org. In order
  to specify the nature of this physical entity, additionalProperty must be used to
  specify the nature/type of this physical entity. For instance, http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_010043
  can be used to refer to a protein.


  Bioschemas usage


  A BioChemEntity is a flexible and extensible wrapper for Life Sciences entities.
  Representations of physical entities in Life Sciences are usually recorded in datasets;
  the link to a dataset should be done via properties. A particular Life Sciences
  entity, refer to as a profile in Bioschemas, will customize BioChemEntity by modifying
  the marginality, cardinality and ontologies used. For instance, a protein profile
  would recommend pointing to an organism a part of the minimum information, but not
  necessarily to a sample or disease.'

    no matching property in schema.org.  Note: Publishers should be aware that applications
    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.'
- bsc_dec: Bioschemas usage.  Additional to the use of name and description to describe
    this property in a human-readable way, additionalType should be used to specify
    the nature of the property/relation. For instance, if the property refers to a
    gene/protein disease association, you could use http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000983
    as additionalType for the additionalProperty.

    a chromosome or sequence or to a physical place where, for instance, a sample

    FALDO can be used for sequence coordinates.

    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.
